================================================================

This program will intially ask the user to chose a number of rows, and number of seats per row. Then it will create a row X seat number sized grid that visually represents the seating arrangement(or a seating map if you may).

The user can then chose one of four options.

1. Show the seats.

This option prints out the seating arrangement previously created as mention above.

2. Buy a ticket

This option prompts the user to choose a seat number and will tell the user the ticket price and change the "S" in the chosen postion to a "B" for bought. The ticket price will then be added to the total profits to be used by the statistics method.

3. Statistics

This option will display various statistics suchs as percentage of seats taken, number of tickets bought, total income, etc.

4. Exit

Exits the program.
